# Oculus Quest2 throw balls

The VR game that I have designed is a Oculuse Quest 2 simulator where the user can move around by walking or with the use of the left joystick. The user can spawn balls on a platform by pushing the right trigger. The user can grab and also throw the balls by controllers that look like hands.

The game is designed in 3D VR and thus the user can look around and move with the motion of the head and hands. An additional part special about this development is that I used unity on Ubuntu 20 for the development which came with its own unique challenges that I had to resolve.

The final project apk is the file finalBallThrow.apk
